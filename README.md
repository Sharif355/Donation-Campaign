# Donation Campaign

- This is a donation campaign website. Where people can donate for the poor people. Here I used React, React Router, Tailwind, React Hooks, Form,PieChart,React Toastify etc.

## Project Features

- **Different Pages**: The application includes three main pages, which are listed below:

  - **Home**: The home page displays a list of possible donation categories. Users can click on a category to view the list of available donation.

  - **Donation Details**: The donation details page displays information about a specific donation. Users can click on the `donate` button to donate for the poor people.

  - **Donation**: The about page displays information about the Donation one's made.

  - **Statistics**: The statistics page displays the total amount of donation and the total number of donation.

  - **Not Found**: The not found page displays a 404 error message to inform users that the requested page is not available.

- **Responsive Design**: Ensure that the application is responsive and works well on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

- **Toast Notifications**: Implement toast notifications to inform users when a donation is made.
